Haxe Template UI
================

A basic utility for testing [Haxe's templates](http://old.haxe.org/doc/cross/template). To run it, [download](https://github.com/player-03/Haxe-Template-UI/raw/master/bin/flash/bin/TemplateUI.swf) the SWF, and choose to open it in your browser. The app is also [available online](http://www.fastswf.com/gO9lK3M), but this may not be current.
